            MyFitnessPal.com, you'll get the tools you need to successfully take
            weight off - and keep it off. And best of all, you can signup for
            free, no strings attached. So put away your credit card - you'll
            never have to pay a cent.

            Study after study has confirmed the benefits of keeping track of the
            food you eat and the activity you do. It's simple - the more
            consistently you track your food intake, the more likely you are to
            lose weight. That's why every successful weight management program
            suggests that you keep a food diary and/or an activity log. But
            recording everything you eat without the right tools can be tedious
            at best, or simply impossible at worst.

            At MyFitnessPal.com, we focus on making sure you can log your meals
            as quickly and easily as possible. Because the easier we make it for
            you, the more likely you are to stay on track, and the more likely
            you are to succeed in your weight loss goals.
